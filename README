What happened to a home page?
� There is no information introducing your company nor what if offers The first thing that is displayed are your products
this should come after an introductory home page
Top banner links are not spaced appropriately (between �CONTACTS� and �PRIVACY POLICY� there is a large space
Should provide a �Back to Shopping�, or similar button, from the shopping cart page
Should identify what payment methods are available
Facebook link non-functional
Grade: 7/10
